**`Digital Craftsman (Developer)`**

I work as an independent full-stack developer, gradually creating my vision of the digital world one step at a time. Every application is created from the ground up, starting with planning and designing and ending with using code to solve practical problems. All the projects are constructed in the same manner, starting with planning and conceptualization and ending with the finalization of the content with aesthetic touches.

 <summary><h3>  👨‍💻 Eric's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    As a naive Electronics and Communication Engineering student, I began my path into coding with a burning desire to understand everything I could about the world of computing. While doing this, I was also training myself in Java development so I could work on the backend of a project, but my main motivation was to become an expert mobile app developer. One aspect of my path, though, has always troubled me: I gave up on my ambition of creating my own software in favor of taking the easy route—getting a job. I've already thrown off that safety net and thrown myself into this strange, unknown world with the determination to always learn modern technologies as I build my projects.
